MCC- Minecraft C Modding Library

The MCC can be used (in the future) to program Minecraft Mods in C or another C-compatible language (C++)

C++ native support is not yet implemented, but is on the TO-DO list.
MCC is licensed under my custom license, the XIPL. I suggest you check it out before downloading.
